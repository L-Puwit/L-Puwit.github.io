            <p>This place is impressive to me because it allows me to relax and gain knowledge all in one place, with both textbooks and board games available. During exam periods, my friends and I come here to study together, or on days when we have to wait for classes, we come here to hang out and play games.</p>

            <p>Next, the most impressive place for me in this campus is the cafeteria in Building 40. It offers a wide variety of food choices, delicious flavors, and importantly, affordable prices.</p>
